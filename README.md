# Polymer

**Polymer** is a student-run 3D printing order site operated under the Lithium name.  
It allows people to view available print types and place custom 3D print orders through a clean, simple web interface.

The site is hosted using **GitHub Pages**, meaning it is:
- Free
- Public
- Secure (HTTPS by default)
- Easy to maintain

🌐 **Live site:**  
https://lithium-company.github.io/polymer/

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML** – site structure
